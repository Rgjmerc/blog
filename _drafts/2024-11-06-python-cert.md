# Personal Statements with Python

## The Personal Statement Struggle

You can seperate people into two categories. Those that experienced the difficulties of applying to college, and those that haven't. The application process is a stressful experience, it feels like all decisions you make cause everlasting affects and thats because they do. These applications have the chance to deside your future.

Personally I had a seprate struggle, and that was my personal statement. I find writing about myself to be incredibly difficult as it requires you to be more descriptive to get across the thoughts and emothions properly. This struggle resulted in me procrastinating until I was told that it was due the following day. This immediately caught me off gaurd.

I realized the severity of the situation and rushed home to quickly not only start but finish my personal statement. having been incredibly limited on time I quickly chose a topic on my passions and wrote.

As stated before I found it difficult to crite aboout myself so freely. After over an hour i was still struggling to actually geta proper basis to wrtrte off of. Time was still ticking and I was to run out of it soon. This prompted me to take a quick break. I had known my limit and I was soon to get burnt out. If that happened it would've been worse overall.

After a nescessary break I returned back to work. I decided to prevent what happened before I would make a mental draft of what points I wanted to get across and the story I was hoping to tell.

This was a massive help as it gave me a good base to work off of. Once I properly got started it was easy to make progress on the statment. I quickly completed the introduction and was soon onto the remaining paragraphs. The Introduction is below.

"Passion is a term used to describe love or care for something significant. Everyone has passion towards something whether it be their partner, a hobby, an item, or even a job; passion is felt all around us. Since I was young, my passion has been computers, and theyâ€™ve led me to where I am today. Growing up, computers were always interesting to me because they could display all different applications and websites on such a small device. This interest only grew with time as I got older and started looking more into how applications and websites were made. Once I reached my junior year of high school I was finally able to properly explore the creation process of software through a program offered to my school."
