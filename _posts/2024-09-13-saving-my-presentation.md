# Saving My Team Cohort Presentation

## The Beginning

It started on April 18th 2024, the beginning steps to our cohort project began. The project that could shape our future. We needed to create a team website that would be presented at the annual STEAM showcase in front of the business owners and other influential people in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

The STEAM showcase was a presentation held by the Brooklyn STEAM Center, which is a program in partnership with our primary high school, and it allowed all of their students to present the projects made in their classes to very influential organizations and people.

This meant that this could be an incredible opportunity for any one of us at the STEAM Center, and we all tried our best to make it that way.
