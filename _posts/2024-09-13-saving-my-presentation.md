# Saving My Team Cohort Presentation

## The Beginning

It started on April 18th 2024, the beginning steps to our cohort project began. The project that could shape our future. We needed to create a team website that would be presented at the annual STEAM showcase in front of the business owners and other influential people in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

The STEAM showcase was a presentation held by the Brooklyn STEAM Center, which is a program in partnership with our primary high school, and it allowed all of their students to present the projects made in their classes to very influential organizations and people.

This meant that this could be an incredible opportunity for any one of us at the STEAM Center, and we all tried our best to make it that way.

## The start of the project

We began our project with the idea of making a trading and shopping website. Once we all agreed on the idea we moved on to the name. After almost a full day of arguing over a name we finally settled on Echo Tradez, and we created a color scheme for the sight.

Eventually after the design steps we decided on what pages would need to be made and split the work where each person would complete 2 web pages for the site.

Through the beginning two weeks of work everything moved along very smoothly. We all worked hard and finished on several web pages for the site combined, and I had even completed the 2 pages we agreed I would complete. It seemed like we would be finished in time for the showcase. Until I left for 4 days straight.

## The Downfall
That moment marked the downfall of our team and after that everything seemed to be falling apart and going into disarray. 

I was gone from Monday-Thursday and I thought since I had finished my portion and everything was going well so far that we would be done by the time I returned. Imagine my surprise when I return and no new pages are completed.

It turned out that from Monday-Tuesday one of my teammates wasn't there and on Wednesday-Thursday another was missing so throughout the week barely anything was completed. I did my best to help them with their pages but even with me helping them it wouldn’t be finished in time.

With less than a week until the showcase everything seemed hopeless. But then I decided I would take more weight so that everyone else could focus solely on the pages they were doing. I ended up taking another 2 pages from the teammates most behind. I hoped that not only could they finish in time but that I could too. I had two days in class and a weekend to finish 2 web pages. 

## Hope?

I knew this would be an incredibly difficult task but I attempted it.

Apparently I had underestimated myself because I managed to complete the pages in two days averaging one page a day. Although it had only taken me two days to complete I was up late in the night those days to complete them.

Immediately after that though, I noticed that my groupmates still hadn't completed their slides except for one. So I also took on the task of another page to complete over the weekend.

## The Moment of Truth

The day of the Showcase came and all slides were completed. Although we weren’t free yet. One of my teammates forgot to upload a webpage that they had completed. With it being the day of the showcase we realized there was absolutely nothing that could be done to fix this and we just went on and presented without it.

The showcase went well and we all connected with some others in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We all managed to present our website to many people and they found it very interesting and were impressed by what we were able to create from scratch in less than a month.

By the end I had completed the most pages, more than double any of my other teammates with 5 pages completed compared to the next person who completed 2. I single handedly saved the project and made it presentable.
